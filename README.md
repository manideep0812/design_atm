# ATM  - Learning Repository

Welcome to the **ATM** repository!  
This project is part of my learning journey in understanding both design patterns and pattern recognition in code, with a focus on ATM (Automated Teller Machine) logic and simulation.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are to:
- Practice and demonstrate my understanding of classic and modern **design patterns**.
- Simulate basic ATM functionalities as a practical application of these design patterns.
- Develop skills in reading, analyzing, and documenting code.
- Learn how to structure, organize, and present code for maintainability and clarity.

---

## Repository Structure

- **ATM/**: Contains the main, structured implementation(s) of ATM operations using design patterns and pattern recognition concepts.
- **atm** and **atm1**: These files showcase my initial understanding and experiments with pattern reading, code analysis, and basic ATM logic.
- **Other files**: Include class diagram and requirements for designing ATM

---

## Design Patterns Covered

Through this project, I explored and applied several design patterns, including (but not limited to):

- **Singleton Pattern:** For ensuring a single instance of core ATM classes (e.g., ATM machine, account manager).
- **Strategy Pattern:** To allow dynamic selection of transaction strategies (e.g., withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry).
- **Factory Pattern:** For object creation, such as generating different transaction or account types.
- **Observer Pattern:** To notify components (like audit logs) about account or transaction changes.
- **Command Pattern:** To encapsulate ATM operations as command objects, enabling undo/redo or transaction queues.

*Note: Not all patterns are implemented in every version; some are explored in initial or experimental files. The code comments highlight where patterns are used or intended.*

## Learnings

By working on this project, I have learned:
- The fundamentals of **design patterns** and their practical application in real-world scenarios.
- How to read, refactor, and recognize patterns in existing code.
- The value of separating concerns and organizing code for scalability.
- The importance of documenting design choices and creating a README for sharing knowledge.
- Practical coding skills including control flow, input/output handling, error checking, and modularization.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manideep0812/design_atm.git
   cd design_atm
   ```

2. **Explore the Code:**
   - Start with `atm` and `atm1` for my early logic and basic pattern recognition.
   - Dive into the `ATM/` directory for implementations that demonstrate design patterns in a simulated ATM context.
   - Look for comments and documentation highlighting design pattern usage.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Follow the instructions in each file (if provided) to execute and test ATM operations.

## Features Implemented

- User authentication (if included)
- Balance inquiry
- Cash withdrawal and deposit
- Transaction history
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular design with applied design patterns

## Conclusion

This repository documents my ongoing journey in mastering software **design patterns** and **pattern recognition**, applied through the practical example of an ATM simulation. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!
